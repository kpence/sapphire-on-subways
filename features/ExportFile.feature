Feature: User can export a Schedule.

Background: Start on the homepage
  Given I am on the DAS home page
  Then I should see "Looks like you don't have any schedules yet!"
  When I attach the file "test_files/small_good_data_test.csv" to "file"
  Then the "file" field within the DAS home page should contain "small_good_data_test.csv"
  When I press "Import from file"
  Then I should be on the Edit Schedule page
  And I should see "Successfully Imported Data!!!"
  Given I am on the Edit Schedule page
  Then I should see the following performances in a table for act 1 in order
  | I Donâ€™t Think About You   |
  | Life is Good              |
  | Sugar                     |
  | All I Ask                 |
  | Sorrow                    |
  And I should see no performances in the table for act 2
  
Scenario: Export Schedule "Test", Page Doesn't Change
