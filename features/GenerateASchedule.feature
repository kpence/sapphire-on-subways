Feature: User can be given a preliminary, conflict-minimized schedule upon uploading an excel file.

Background: Start on the homepage
  Given I am on the DAS home page
  Then I should see "Looks like you don't have any schedules yet! Click the button to upload your first one!"
  When I attach the file "test_files/good_data_test.csv" to "file"
  Then the "file" field within the DAS home page should contain "good_data_test.csv"
  When I press "Import from file"
  Then I should be on the Edit Schedule page
  And I should see "Successfully Imported Data!!!"
Scenario: See a Schedule after uploading first data
  Given I am on the Edit Schedule page
  Then I should see the following performances in a table
