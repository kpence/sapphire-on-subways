Feature: User can see what conflicts there are between dances in a schedule

Background: Start on the homepage
  Given I am on the DAS home page
  Then I should see "Looks like you don't have any schedules yet!"
  When I attach the file "test_files/small_good_data_test.csv" to "file"
  Then the "file" field within the DAS home page should contain "small_good_data_test.csv"
  When I press "Import from file"
  Then I should be on the Edit Schedule page
  And I should see "Successfully Imported Data!!!"

Scenario: See Conflicts for a Small Schedule
  Given I am on the Edit Schedule page
  Then I should see the following performances in a table in this order
  | Act 1                     |
  | I Donâ€™t Think About You   |
  | Life is Good              |
  | Sugar                     |
  | All I Ask                 |
  | Sorrow                    |
  And I should see the following table in this order
  | Act 2                     |
  And I should see "Amber Krizan" in between "All I Ask" and "Sorrow"
